# Light

Directional lights and point lights!

:::info
Light assets are great for illuminating characters or adjusting existing environmental lighting. If you have a large number of light assets in fixed positions, it is probably worthwhile to set them up directly in Unity and export the [environment ](environment.md)with the [Warudo SDK](../modding/mod-sdk.md).
