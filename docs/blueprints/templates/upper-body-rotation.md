# Upper Body Rotation

By default, Warudo's face tracking does not rotate the character's upper body. This blueprint allows you to add subtle but realistic upper body rotation to your character, adding nuance to your character's body expression.

<div style={{width: '100%'}} className="video-box"><video controls loop src="/doc-img/upper-body-rotation.mp4" /></div>
<p class="img-desc">Naturally rotating the upper body when turning the head.</p>

## Prerequisites

You should have already set up face tracking for your character.

## Setup

Download the blueprint below and import it into your scene.

<a href="/blueprints/upper-body-rotation.json" target="_blank" download>
<div className="file-box">
<p>
upper-body-rotation.json
</p></div>
</a>

This blueprint should work out of the box. Follow the instructions on the **Comment** nodes to adjust the settings.

:::tip
If you have created another character asset, you may need to update the **Character** option on the nodes.
