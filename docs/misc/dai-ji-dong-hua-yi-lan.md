# Idle Animations at a Glance

Since Warudo's configuration interface does not support displaying images for now, and there are more than 500 default idle animations, you can use this page to find the idle animation you want, and select the number (e.g. `010_0010`) corresponding to the option in "Animation" -> "Default Idle Animation" of your character.
